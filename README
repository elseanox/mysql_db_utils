MySQL DB Utilities from Meep Freak (elseano@gmail.com)

This repo contains a number of Linux/unix utilities to ease administration.
Many of the tools expect parameters to be set as variables from within.


p - Dumps essential full processlist and show engine innodb status output to the files proc.out and inno.out. p backs up previous versions with a timestamp. 

    invocation - ./p (you will be prompted for the root mysql password if $PASS is unset)

    Pro Tips:
    Sorting the processlist using './p | sort -nr -k 6' will give you a reverse sort of all queries by execution time. 
    Grepping inno.out like this 'grep TRANSACTION inno.out' will output of all the innodb transaction thread ids. The bottom of stack is the 'oldest' or rather a 'long running' query that may be a blocker.


db_canary_query - Pings a mysql server with the query of your choice. Writes to a log. Alerts if pingtime is over threshold. Signals unexpected swapping or virtual machine resource weather issues.

    invocation example: nohup <path>/db_canary_query & (runs for a week)
    cron example: 0 0 * * 6 <path>/db_canary_query 



eth_to_serverid - concocts a pseudo-unique server id for mysql replication based on the outbound eth or bond address

  invocation example: eth_to_serverid

  returns something like: 100215



long_query_alarm - emails an address of your choice with the worst offending query that is executing longer than LONG_QUERY_TIME

  invocation example: long_query_alarm

  returns an email containing: mysql query thread id, execution time, query string
  


schema_size_report - returns the size of all schemas on a mysql instance (omits mysql, information_schema and performance_schema)

  invocation example: ./schema_size_report  

  returns a formatted list of schemas and their size in megabytes
  
  

host_port_ping - checks for the presence of a demon running at host:port reports on fail to an email address, 60 second interval

  invocation example: ./host_port_pint 10.0.0.2 3306 someone@email.com
  
  returns success or email spew on failure
